    <p>
      You are responsible for safeguarding your own password and should never disclose it to any
      third party.
    </p>
    <h2>DMCA Compliance</h2>
    <p>
      The Xenharmonic Developers wants to ensure that the content that we host can be re-used by
      other users without fear of liability and that it is not infringing the proprietary rights of
      others. In fairness to our users, as well as to other creators and copyright holders, our
      policy is to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the formalities of
      the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Pursuant to the DMCA, we will terminate, in
      appropriate circumstances, users and account holders of our system and network who are repeat
      infringers.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, we also recognize that not every takedown notice is valid or in good faith. In such
      cases, we strongly encourage users to file counter-notifications when they appropriately
      believe a DMCA takedown demand is invalid or improper. For more information on what to do if
      you think a DMCA notice has been improperly filed, you may wish to consult the Chilling
      Effects website.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are the owner of content that is being improperly used on one of the application
      without your permission, you may request that the content be removed under the DMCA. To make
      such a request, please email us at lumi.pakkanen<img

      Alternatively, you may make a request to our community, which often handles copyright issues
      faster and more effectively than prescribed under the DMCA. In that case, you can post a
      notice explaining your copyright concerns. Before filing a DMCA claim, you also have the
      option of sending an email to the community at lumi.pakkanen<img
